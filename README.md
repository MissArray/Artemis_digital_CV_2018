# Artemis_digital_CV_2018
Stating in a CV that you're fluent in a language is mere information. As a multilingual career-changer, I am aware that it's only when you come to speak and write in a new language that you can truly demonstrate how fluent you are. 

Applying the same principle to coding skills, I've created a digital CV that indicates how far I've progressed into web-design territory from my starting point as a copy-editor in July 2018.
